Latinx ,"One of the major barriers to accessing care (specifically pap smears) is the double whammy of being a survivor of sexual violence and agender.  So getting a pap smear is retraumatizing, but the ways that my doctors have often dealt with that is by leaning hard into gendered language--it's so important for me to get a pap smear to protect my womanhood, so that I can be a mother, etc.  (One PCP did a whole, like, Divine Feminine/Mother Goddess thing which would have been funny if I weren't on the verge of a panic attack the whole time.)  So the combination of ""I have to do this thing that is deeply physically uncomfortable and will set off my PTSD for the rest of the day"" and ""my provider will 'helpfully' misgender me the whole time"" makes me avoid pap smears for as long as I can.  Also, because I'm asexual and have never had consensual sex, providers get really confused about how to deal with me.  Perhaps the most telling exchange was when a PCP asked me about the genders of my past partners.  I asked if she was asking what had come into contact with my genitals in what configurations, and she said, no, she was asking about past partners.  I said the genders of my partners, and then pointed out that two of the three had been trans and one of those partners I had not been sexually active with and asked again if she was asking what had come in contact with genitals.  She said no again, but then was shocked when I told her that I'd never had PIV sex (after she ignored me and tried to use a regular size speculum when I said the regular size wouldn't fit).
