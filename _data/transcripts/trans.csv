However, clinics that serve LGBTQIA2S folks often have high turnover. I've been going to my current clinic for 3.5 years, and have had my care transferred to new PCPs 3-4 times. This can be super disruptive to any type of care, but especially with folks scheduling blood panels/tests/check-ups that follow a timeline. It also creates major time scarcity, since there isn't always a new provider lined up when one leaves, and cases are often transferred to the other doctors on staff, making it hard to schedule with them.",Navigating care; Long wait times and delays; Wins,"Navigating care, Long wait times and delays, Wins",Other provider bias

When i was preparing for top surgery, my meetings with my surgeon depressed me because she would always comment on how big i was on top. I lost trust in her, thinking it was obvious she shouldn’t make comments like that… ???

I was on Regence BCBS for several years through my employment, but lost my job in Jan 2025 and quickly applied for OHP. From Feb - Apr I had double coverage through Regence and OHP. I ended up in the ER for a serious mouth infection in Feb, Regence would barely cover any of my ER costs, but OHP covered all of it, saving me $10K -THANK YOU OHP!!!! In April I finally had the capacity to start looking for surgeons for top surgery. I contacted the following providers: Legacy Emanuel, OHSU, and The Oregon Clinic East. Legacy Emanuel's Dr Thatcher was the most highly recommended and most popular among my social circles. I never heard back from Legacy, I'm sure they are swamped. I heard back from OHSU quickly, they emailed saying that current estimated wait time for top surgery intake/consult is two years; they said they are getting a lot of requests for surgery while having staffing shortages. They also said to contact the clinic directly for most up to date wait times. OHSU also emailed a 23 page booklet with a provider list for all types of gender affirming care, that was SO helpful. I am grateful. I was able to schedule a consult with The Oregon Clinic (East) April 18 and receive insurance approval by end of May to schedule surgery. The earliest surgery date was August but I opted for November instead.",Wins,Wins,Wins

White","Because my health insurance provides my testosterone through the mail, it makes accessing testosterone very accessible. I used to face a lot more bias, lack of education, and fear of transphobia when I had to go to an in person pharmacy. While my testosterone is accessible, the needles that I need for injection are not. Even though I don’t like buying medical supplies on Amazon, I always buy my injection needles in bulk on Amazon now because I got sick of pharmacies either not having the needle sizes I need in stock, or not understanding what needles I actually need even when I told them the specific size. Several times I had pharmacists give me insulin needles which are useless for testosterone. This even happened when the pharmacist knew I was picking up my testosterone at the same time. 
My health insurance also has a whole department for gender related care, and these providers are available online which makes it accessible. However my assigned doctor in the gender clinic has had instances of not taking my personal experiences seriously or pushing back telling me that things I have experiences “aren’t possible” or “aren’t supposed to happen.”",Wins; Provider minimizes concerns; Lack of provider knowledge,"Wins, Provider minimizes concerns, Lack of provider knowledge",Affirming experiences

Black or African American,"I was treated very harshly by nurses during my chest reduction surgery due to my race. I had a bruise on my hand from having a thick anesthesia needle bag puncture it too many times in the same spot, and I wake up with paralysis of that hand's two fingers even til this day, years later. The treatment during the surgery scarred me and made the healing process traumatic. Additionally, I was not notified of the full process of accessing HRT by my healthcare provider. I endured over a year of combating extreme gender dysphoria alone to finally complete my process of accessing HRT (securing the WPATH letter, getting medicated, and reducing cholesterol levels). During the time I was securing the WPATH letter and getting medication, I should have been notified that I still wouldn't be allowed on HRT until I lost weight and got my cholesterol levels down so I could work on both requirements at once. My cholesterol levels were not at dangerous levels, but gender affirming care was withheld from me for another half year until I intensely dieted and worked out to meet normal fat levels. It took a toll on my mental health and was also difficult for me because I already have numerous eating restrictions as a symptom of my physical disability.",Lack of provider knowledge; Transphobia; Medical harm; Medical trauma,"Lack of provider knowledge, Transphobia, Medical harm, Medical trauma",
